# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [How to kill child of fork? (thread)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13273836/how-to-kill-child-of-fork)<br>
If you've ever read programming memes, then you might've stumbled across a meme about "killing child with fork". This article is the origin of that meme, and it actually is a great resource to understand that meme, and ofcourse understanding about fork in general. The answer to this question is `kill(pid, SIGTERM);`. I guess one of the ways to learn is getting curious from a meme!

2. [Reading 17: Concurrency (article)](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa14/classes/17-concurrency/)<br>
I know what concurrency is, but i don't think i KNOW what concurrency is. This is the first time I've included an article from MIT, and I'm not surprised on how detailed the article is. There are two models of concurrent programming, shared memory and message passing. In a more modular component, there are threads and processes in a concurrent system. TLDR, concurrency is multiple computations running simultaneously, it is a necessary tool to have in modern software development and have to be implemented correctly to avoid problems such as race condition.

3. [What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism? (thread)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050222/what-is-the-difference-between-concurrency-and-parallelism)<br>
Another topic closely related to concurrency is `paralellism`, yet they are different. This article is another `stackoverflow` thread, and it is perfect as it is one of the most asked questions and therefore have many and high quality answers. To explain concurrency, I'm quotiong Rob Pike, the creator of go, "just break up this long sequential task so that you can do something useful while you wait.". I still haven't fully understand the difference, but from what I've read, the difference is `concurrency` is a clever way of splitting tasks so when there is no synchronize needed, a single-core machine can multitask computations, whereas `parralellism` is when multiple operations run literally at the same time, as they are run on a multi-core processor.

4. [Concurrency is not Parallelism. Rob Pike at Waza 2012 (article/video)](https://blog.heroku.com/concurrency_is_not_parallelism)<br>
From the creator of the `Go` programming language, this is a must read/listen/watch link as it has video + article explanation + audio form of explaining concurrency and parralellism. This is a great complement to strengthen your understanding if you're still confused from the previous number in this week's currated list. Rob explains amazingly with visuals and I'll try to explain it here. Task: let's obsolete documentation, **one by one**. Concurrency: one worker burning multiple documentation. Pararellism: multiple workers burning multiple documentation.

5. [Difference between Process and Thread (article)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-process-and-thread/)<br>
Taking a more low level understanding of concurrency, threads and processes are what makes concurrency possible. I've actually explained this in my week2 compilation, but it's great to learn more about it. "A thread is a single sequence stream within a process, sometimes called a lightweight process. Threads are used to improve applications using concurrency." This geeksforgeeks article also has visualization in the form of pictures and a table of difference, which I love and highly recommend on reading to undestand more about these important concepts.
