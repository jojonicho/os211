# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [What is the difference between adduser and useradd? (thread)](https://askubuntu.com/questions/345974/what-is-the-difference-between-adduser-and-useradd)<br>
This surprisingly halt my Linux From Scratch experience, as they are both similar commands, yet one is much better than other. From this article, I learned that useradd is native binary compiled with the system while adduser is a perl script which uses useradd binary in back-end. TLDR, use adduser, as it will handle things such as password creation and home directory creation and assignment. (I've tried with useradd, even when you've created the home directory, you won't be assigned with it).

2. [Difference between Asymmetric and Symmetric Multiprocessing (article)
](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-asymmetric-and-symmetric-multiprocessing/)<br>
Inspired by the question asked in class, I wanted to learn more about the difference between asymmetric and symmetric multiprocessing. Articles made by G4G are always great, this one's no different. This article has diagrams as well as tables to help understand the difference between these two multiprocessing types. In asymmetric multiprocessing, only the master processor runs the tasks of an OS. Symmteric multiprocessing however, every processors are treated equally.

3. [CPU Scheduling : Finding burst time (thread)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24848864/cpu-scheduling-finding-burst-time)<br>
What is CPU burst? CPU burst: the amount of time the process uses the processor before it is no longer ready, and then what?. This stackoverflow article is a great repository for even more links, as shared by the top voted answer. This article discusses the topic of finding burst time. From my understanding, schedulers estimate the lenght of the next burst based on recent cpu bursts. It is basically algorithmic guessing by assuming every event is related (non-independent). Second top answers also gives the formula
- Estimated CPU Burst time for (n+1)th CPU burst=(alpha)(Actual CPU Burst time for nth CPU Burst)+(1-alpha)(Estimated CPU Burst time for nth CPU Burst).

4. [Round Robin scheduling (thread)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4081999/round-robin-scheduling)<br>
This article is interesting, as it takes on a more university-test-problem question. Thread starter asked the following question, given the recent CPU and I/O bursts and their respective length in time units, describe it's state transition. Round robin is very popular in learning about scheduling and load balancing, but it has it's flaws such as uneven work deistribution. I learned a bit more about the theoretical side of this load balancer.

5. [Introduction to CPU Scheduling (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWkQl0n0w5M)<br>
Neso Academy is my go-to youtuber for digital systems, computer organization, and now operating systems. Their videos are complete and detailed, this one's no different. I now understand that CPU scheduling is the time we are assigning to different processes for their utilization of the CPU. We don't want the CPU to remain idle, I.E when the CPU is waiting for something to complete. By assigning the CPU to another process during that waiting time, we reduce idle time and maximize the utilization of CPU. 

6. [CPU and I/O Burst Cycles (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzb3TUcDLo)<br>
Now that I've understand CPU scheduling, the next step is to learn about CPU and I/O burst cycles. Video is also from NesoAcademy, very detailed, but I'll try to summarize what I've just learned. A process can be in either two states: `CPU execution state` or `I/O wait`. They also alternate between each other. CPU bursts is the `time` when the process is in CPU execution state. The same goes for I/O bursts.
