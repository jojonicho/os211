# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [SHA256 online hash function](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html)<br>
If you've read my previous list in Week 01, you know I love interactivity and practice as it is proven to be a more effective way to learn rather than just memorizing. This tool converts your input into SHA256 encription with live auto updates. One of the interesting new things that I've learned from this website is that the length of the encrypted message doesn't change. Not only that, you can also change to other different hash functions such as SHA512 and SHA384.

2. [Difference between Private key and Public key](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-private-key-and-public-key/)<br>
For some, this might sound as something mysterious, but it's actually not. GeeksforGeeks is notorious for it's widespread and detailed information around computer science topics. This article is concise, explains the difference between a `private` and `public` key. In short, private key, as it is named, should not be exposed to the public. It is symmetrical because it is the secret key which you can encrypt and decrypt messages, where as the public key is assymmetrical, meaning that you can encrypt a message but not decrypt it. For more information on asymmetric encryption, please check out my next article up on the list.

3. [What is Asymmetric Encryption? Understand with Simple Examples](https://cheapsslsecurity.com/blog/what-is-asymmetric-encryption-understand-with-simple-examples/)<br>
My way of learning is top-bottom, meaning I like to learn something by doing it first, then learning what I just did in a more detailed way. Elon musk explained it best where he describes using tools to solve a problem, rather than learning each tools in such a detailed manner, but not really having that connection with the tool and problem. Following the previous article, we're now going to go on a deeper dive about `asymmetric encryption`, which is how public and private keys work.<br>I love this article as it is light on the theoretical side, has great explanations, plus has illustrations if that's how you like to learn.

4. [101 Bash Commands and Tips for Beginners to Experts](https://dev.to/awwsmm/101-bash-commands-and-tips-for-beginners-to-experts-30je#whereis-which-whatis)<br>
If there is a `buku rumus jitu` such as one for preparing SBMPTN exams, this is the one, but for bash commands. It is a bit lengthy, but that's it's strong point and it is not meant for a single sitting read. This article is also structured very well, starting out with single commands and explaining while giving code examples starting ranging from commands such as `touch` to making environment variables. The juicy part of the article is at the section of `bash scripts`, where you get to see all these different commands come together as you get a little more confident in reading, and possibly make one of your own .sh file for your daily needs. 

5. [How to customize .bashrc to configure command prompt?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12335/how-to-customize-bashrc-to-configure-command-prompt)<br>
As the command prompt that we'll be using every time we use the VirtualBox on debian guest, it is a great idea to know more on how `bash`, the command prompt, works. I love `stackexchange` / `stackoverflow` articles as it is `amati, tiru, modifikasi` at it's finest. This thread has many solutions that you can copy and paste onto you `.bashrc` file to make your Operating Systems experience a little more exciting. You can add `aliases` to reduce boilerplate on commands you typically have to type verbosely on a regular basis. You can also change the promp text color, for example from the hacker-looking green into pink (which I personally love). Also to finish it off, dont forget to run `source .bashrc` for the changes to take effect.
