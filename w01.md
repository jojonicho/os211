# Top 10 List of Week 01

# this is a curated list for you who are stressed out about this week's assignments. These reading materials won't make you an expert in these topics, but certainly makes it less scary to take the first step in learning these topics.

1. [How to customize .bashrc to configure command prompt?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12335/how-to-customize-bashrc-to-configure-command-prompt)<br>
As the command prompt that we'll be using every time we use the VirtualBox on debian guest, it is a great idea to know more on how `bash`, the command prompt, works. I love `stackexchange` / `stackoverflow` articles as it is amati, tiru, modifikasi at it's finest. This thread has many solutions that you can copy and paste onto you `.bashrc` file to make your Operating Systems experience a little more exciting. You can add `aliases` to reduce boilerplate on commands you typically have to type verbosely on a regular basis. You can also change the promp text color, for example from the hacker-looking green into pink (which I personally love). Also to finish it off, dont forget to run `source .bashrc` for the changes to take effect.

2. [Vim Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiwGbcd8S7I&ab_channel=BenAwad)<br>
   I've had the pleasure of knowing Ben Awad ever since I was a freshman trying to learn and explore the web development space. One of the skills that I've gain from watching his videos is learning how to `Vim`. This such a great tool to have as it speeds up my typing experience with so many shortcuts. Now I can't live without `vim`. Commands I frequently use:

   - `dd` delete a line
   - `p` paste below and `P` paste above
   - `o` put cursor below `O` put cursor above
   - `dw` delete word and `cw` delete word + enter insert mode
   - `r` replace a character
   - `w` move cursor by next word and `b` move back cursor by a word

3. [Learn Regex Interactively](https://regexr.com/)<br>
Actually this spot was mean for this article
[Everything you need to know about Regular Expressions](https://towardsdatascience.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-regular-expressions-8f622fe10b03) but it is a medium article and I'm concerned that the person opening this has already used his/her 3 month free articles. To be honest with you, I still think that regular expressions are scary, but useful. As a web developer, on of the most popular use case to use regex is to check a user's input such as if a password has an uppercase, a number, a character, and is minimum, let's say, 6 characters in length. It is a powerful tool, yet can be easily googled for when you forget hwo to.<br>This website has so many interactivity such as hover to get information on what the regular expression is filtering. You'll also gain confidence as there are texts that will be selected based on the regular expression currently typed, confirming your regex is right or wrong. Also, the medium article I mentioned above takes the quota of 1 read out of 3 free reads for the non paid version of medium. It explains really detailed about the numerous symbols such as `?`, `^`, `$2-$1`, `[A-Za-z]` which will demistify the gap between you and taking a step towards learning about regular expressions.

4. [Jekyll Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB)<br>
   It's nice to go out of your comfort zone, and `Jekyll` is not my usual React, Node, Django tech stack for web development.<br>
   This tutorial is made by `GiraffeAcademy`, you've probably seen him as he explains almost every language there is with such a beginner friendly tone and curriculum. <br> This tutorial starts from setting up a `Jekyll` project to serving up markdowns. You'll get used to commands such as `bundle install` and `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

5. [Basic Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)<br>
   One of my main concerns of students in University of Indonesia is the lack of experience with state of the art technologies, one of them is `git`. This concern hit me harder when, in 1/3/2021 OS class, a student, i presume who is already in his 4th semester, didn't know how to use the most basic feature of software development using `git`, which is the `git pull` and `git push commmand`. <br> This one page tutorial covers MOST of the basic commands you'll need for basic daily `git` usage.

6. [About pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)<br>
   Looking for more `git` commands to further your software engineering journey? Next up is pull requests. It is a highly useful skill to have and to copmlement the materials of the topic in the previous article. The next step you should learn after you're comfortable with the basic `git` commands is how to make a `pull request`. It is the single most important topic to learn for `open source software development`. If you're a computer science student, this is also a life safer for the `hell-like` that is `g r o u p - a s s i g n m e n t s`. <br>This article explains in a step by step way of how to create a pull request and hopefully will aid you in group assignments / projects in the future. 

7. [Learn To Write Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)<br>
   Documentation is such an important piece in software development, yet so easy to be neglected. <br> Continuing from the previous article's topic, this is an `interactive article` where you don't only read, but experience yourself how to write `Markdown`. You'll learn the basic markdown types such as `# ## ###` headings, how to write [Links](https://jojonicho.gtsb.io) and many - many more. One of the thing's you can do straight away by learning markdown is to document `Pull Requests` so that in the future, when a project gets big, you'll be able to read what each `Pull Requests` do without scratching your head.

8. [Linux Commands Cheat Sheet](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet/)<br>
   Back to the topic of unix/linux commands, because there are so many commands, its useful to have a `cheat sheet` to have a quick lookup whenever you forget what a command does. Some of the new commands that I've learned are:

   - `sort` : sorts the lines of text
   - `cat` : reads file and throws it up in the terminal
   - `find`
   - `grep`
   - `chmod`
   - `diff`

9. [What is the difference between sed and awk? [closed]
   ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1632113/what-is-the-difference-between-sed-and-awk)<br>
   At this point, the one I'm still not comfortable is the `sed` and `awk` command. This `stackoverflow` thread explains perfectly what they do, as expected of the `stackoverflow` community!<br>

   - sed is a stream editor. It works with streams of characters on a per-line basis. It has a primitive programming language that includes goto-style loops and simple conditionals (in addition to pattern matching and address matching). There are essentially only two "variables": pattern space and hold space.
   - wk is oriented toward delimited fields on a per-line basis. It has much more robust programming constructs including if/else, while, do/while and for (C-style and array iteration).

10. [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)<br>
    Finally, time for the big boss. The idea of linux from scratch definitely intimidates me, but I managed to get through installing a debian guest from the help of mr RMS's lecture notes. `Linux From Scratch` is a book, [download link](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/LFS-BOOK-10.1.pdf) which consists of around 300 pages. This should come handy in my future OS endevors.
