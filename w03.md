# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [How to extract metadata from a image using python?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21697645/how-to-extract-metadata-from-a-image-using-python)<br>
Again, I've chosen a stackoverflow thread as my link of choice. This time, the topic is about metadata, specifically the technical side of extracting metadata. This thread discusses metadata extraction using the `python` library `pil` and this should be interesting for anyone who wants to get a deeper experience of extracting metadata with basic knowledge of python. 

2. [Why You Can't Name A File CON In Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC6tngl0PTI&ab_channel=TomScott)<br>
This topic is more on the interesting side rather than an informative one, but still worth a spot on this list, nonetheless. In short, you can't name a file or folder with `CON`. Why is that? `CON`, which is short for `console` is one of several words that are names of `device files`. I actually don't know what will happen, but another `device files` word is LPT1, the port on your computer. Hilariously, if you try to create a file named LPT1, you can actually trigger your printer to print those characters (based on tom scott). Definitely a must try for you windows user folks.

3. [Spotlight: Don’t take your Mac’s powerful search engine for granted](https://www.macworld.com/article/3388134/spotlight-dont-take-your-macs-powerful-search-engine-for-granted.html)<br>
If you're using a mac, then you should know the search engine called `spotlight`. Spotlight is mac's search engine for things ranging from Applications to files. Spotlight is pretty fast, as it uses a method called `indexing`, a term you might be familiar with if you've already taken `database` course in college. From this article, I learned that spotlight indexes the text of every document it can find, really impressive! You can even use `NOT` and `OR` to filter searches.  

4. [What Is a TAR File?](https://www.lifewire.com/tar-file-2622386)<br>
I've never actually know what a TAR file is, and what a better time to learn it than now? Tar is usually referred as `tarball` and is an extention file in the `Consolidated Unix Archive` format. Similar to a `zip` file, you need a program or command to extract it, but different from zip files, tar files aren't compressed.
Making a TAR file: `tar -czvf name-of-archive.tar.gz /path/to/folder-or-file` 
Extracting a TAR file: `tar -xvf file.tar`
This article is beginner friendly and has code examples, which I love.

5. [What Does .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 Mean?](https://www.howtogeek.com/409742/how-to-extract-files-from-a-.tar.gz-or-.tar.bz2-file-on-linux/)<br>
Continuing from last number's topic, I'd like to learn more about `tar.gz` or `tar.bz2` as it sounds very mysterious. This article is kind enough to explain, also with code examples, on what those file extentions are. Basically, tar.gz and tar.bz2 are tar files, but compressed. I personally loved this article as it explains the arguments:<br>
-x: Extract, retrieve the files from the tar file.<br>
-v: Verbose, list the files as they are being extracted.<br>
-z: Gzip, use gzip to decompress the tar file.<br>
-f: File, the name of the tar file we want tar to work with. This option must be followed by the name of the tar file.<br>
Code snippet for extraction of bz2 and gz tars:<br>
`tar -xvjf guitar_songs.tar.bz2`<br>
`tar -xvzf ukulele_songs.tar.gz`<br>
Key points:<br>
.bz2 extention means it's been compressed using the bzip2 command.<br>
the j in -xvjf flag in the command snippet is for bzip2 option.<br>
