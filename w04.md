# Top 10 List of Week 04
Keywords: memory, virtualization, paging, segmentation, disc, thrashing, swapping, page table.

1. [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)<br>
We're starting this week off with my favorite Operating Systems book titled `Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces`. I've personally read it because I was preparing for my technical interview at Garena (if you read my curated list for week 2 you might remember I mentioned this). (p.s. I failed the interview). I love this book so much at it is lengthy yet very concise. It is also structured very well into three main parts (hence the title): `Virtualization (Memory)`, `Concurrency`, and `Persistence`. Last week's material was closely related with `persistence` as I've discussed about file systems, dfs, nfs. Please read more about in [Top 10 List of Week 03](https://jojonicho.github.io/os211/W03/). I chose this book as it is a must read and gives a detailed yet high overview on what to learn and expect from an Operating System course.

2. [Segmented, Paged and Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9yZNLeOj4s&ab_channel=ComputerScience)<br>
This topic is about comparing memory virtualization methods. It compares segmented and paged memory. This video is highly visualized, thus helps me understand what actually happens in memory virtualization. In general, paged memory is better than segmented memory as it avoid fragmentation. Paged memory has a fixed size where it divides memory into fixed size units. It is also flexible, enabling sparse use of virtual address spaces. Do check out the `Computer Science` youtube channel as it has beginner friendly explanations for you folks who want to learn more about OS/CS.

3. [Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
It is inevitable that I include a GeeksForGeeks article. It explains basically the same as the previous youtube video, but in more detailed and in an article structure. It also explains in more detail about `Swapping` and `Thrashing`, two key concepts you should know about when learning about `Virtualizing Memory`. Swapping happens to pages when the memory is full. It swaps the page not used in the memory into a secondary memory, disc, and then it will be swapped back in when needed. Thrashing happens when this event occurs very frequently. The system spends most of it's time mostly on swapping pages rather than executing the actual instruction.

4. [Page Table](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-page-table)<br>
Another great website to learn CS fundamentals from is on `JavaTPoint`. This is a bit of a `POK` or `IDS` refresher with concepts from `Database` course. I've explained before about memory virtualization, but how does it actually `virtualize` memory? Well it turns out that it uses a table called `Page Table` which maps the `virtualized memory address` to the actual address in physical memory. It is a simple yet important concept to strengthen your database and ids fundamentals. The article also has pictures and illustrations to strengthen and clear your doubts.
